Search-ESsearcher

bin/essearcher provides a handy method for having a handy extensible
script for running elasticsearch searches and displaying the results.

The options on the commandline are dynamic and used to fill in the
search template. Each returned item is then ran through the output
template.

Search::ESsearcher largely exists for the purpose of that script.

Example logstash configs to help get you started using this are
included under the directory logstash. Just set the host and port
variables as desired and you should be good to got.
